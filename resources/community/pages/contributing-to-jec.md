# Contributing to JEC

Contributions to JEC include code, documentation, answering user questions, running the project's infrastructure, and advocating for all types of JEC users.

The JEC project welcomes all contributions from anyone willing to work in good faith with other contributors and the community. No contribution is too small and all contributions are valued.

This guide explains the process for contributing to the JEC project's [`jec-project/JEC`][github-url] GitHub repositories and describes what to expect at each step.

## Code of Conduct

The JEC project has a [Code of Conduct](./community/code-of-conduct) that all contributors are expected to follow. This code describes the minimum behavior expectations for all contributors.

## Improving the Documentation

Improving the documentation, examples, and other open source content can be the easiest way to contribute to the library. If you see a piece of content that can be better, [submit a Pull Request](./community/submission-guidelines#submitting-a-pull-request) with an improvement, no matter how small!

## Unit Testing Matters!

## Found a Bug?

If you find a bug in the source code, you can help us by [submitting an issue](./community/submission-guidelines#submitting-an-issue) to our [GitHub Repository][github-url]. Even better, you can submit a Pull Request with a fix.

## Missing a Feature?

You can _request_ a new feature by [submitting an issue ](./community/submission-guidelines#submitting-an-issue) to our [GitHub Repository][github-url]. If you would like to implement a new feature, please submit an issue with a proposal for your work first, to be sure that we can use it. Please consider what kind of change it is:

- For a **Major Feature**, first open an issue and outline your proposal so that it can be discussed. This will also allow us to better coordinate our efforts, prevent duplication of work, and help you to craft the change so that it is successfully accepted into the project.
- **Small Features** can be crafted and directly [submitted as a Pull Request](./community/submission-guidelines#submitting-a-pull-request).
