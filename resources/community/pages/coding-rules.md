# Coding Rules

To ensure consistency throughout the source code, keep these rules in mind as you are working:

- All features or bug fixes must be tested by one or more [Unit Tests](./community/coding-rules#unit-testing).
- All API members (public, private, protected, contructor...) must be documented.
- We wrap all code at 80 characters.
