# Communicating About JEC

## General JEC reference guidelines

You may use **JEC reference** _("JEC", "JavaScript Enterprise Containe")_  (but not logos or taglines) to identify JEC products, services, and programs on packaging, promotional, and advertising materials, provided you meet the following guidelines:

- You may not include any JEC reference in your company name, product or service name, or domain name.
- You may not include any JEC reference in your social media account name, page(s) or community, without written authorization from the JEC Project Owner, except to describe the purpose by referring to the JEC product.
- You may not include any JEC logo or product icon design, whole or in part, in your company logo, your product logo, your app launch tile image, in your software product or service or in your social media account, page(s) or community images without a prior written license from the JEC Project Owner.
- You should use an appropriate generic term after a JEC reference the first time it appears in a publication and as often as possible after that.
- Your product name may not be confusingly similar to any JEC reference.
- You may not use any JEC reference on or in connection with any obscene or pornographic materials, and your use of any JEC reference may not be disparaging, defamatory, or libelous to the JEC Project, any of its products, or any person or entity.
- You may not use JEC references in any manner that directly or indirectly expresses or implies JEC Project sponsorship, affiliation, certification, approval, or endorsement in relation to your product or service or in such a manner that it appears that JEC is legally associated with your company.
- A JEC reference may not be the most prominent visual element on packaging, a download page, app store marketing, or other marketing materials for your product or service. Your company name or logo, your product or service name, and your graphic identity should be significantly larger than any JEC reference.
- If you refer to a JEC project, you should use the full name of the project in the first and most prominent reference.
- You may not shorten, abbreviate, or modify any JEC reference.
