# What Is GlassCat?

![GlassCat Server](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jec-project/JEC/master/assets/glasscat.png =150x150 "GlassCat Server")

GlassCat is a **Web Applications Server** which provides advanced functionalities for creating, building and deploying scalable JavaScript applications.

GlassCat Server is developed through the JEC project open-source
community at [http://jecproject.org/](http://jecproject.org/).

## A complete client/server solution

As the JEC reference implementation, GlassCat Server ships with all JEC specifications implementations, such as:

- **Jslet**: the default implementation of the `jec-exchange` API
- **Sandcat**: the default implementation of the JavaScript API for RESTful Services _(JARS)_ specification
- **Sokoke**: the default implementation of the JavaScript Dependency Injection _(JDI)_ specification

Moreover, GlassCat includes many production tools, as:

- **Wildcat**: the archetypes manager for the GlassCat Application Server
- **Cheetoh**: the GlassCat Project Model _(GPM)_ loader
- **Tiger**: the GlassCat JavaScript Unit Testing API _(JUTA)_ implementation

## A productive solution

GlassCat Server is fully integrated with the JEC Command Line Interface _(JEC CLI)_.

JEC CLI allows developers to focus on applications development, by providing automated tools to achieve tedious tasks:

- GlassCat Server one-command installation: `jec glasscat-install`
- creation of various class stubs (eg. jslets, JERS resourses, etc.)
- management of Enterprise JavaScript Projects _(EJPs)_
