## JUTA Implementation

JEC JUTA provides an abstraction layer for writing unit test based upon the [TypeScript language](https://www.typescriptlang.org/). You can design all of your unit  tests by using the JUTA API; but you need to install a JUTA implementation to run them in your development environment.

The default JEC JUTA Implementation is the Tiger framework. For more information about the Tiger framework, please visit the [jec-tiger](https://github.com/jec-project/jec-tiger) project page.

You can see JUTA and [Tiger](https://github.com/jec-project/jec-tiger) in action by downloading the [**Tiger sample application here**](https://github.com/jec-project/jec-sample-tiger).
