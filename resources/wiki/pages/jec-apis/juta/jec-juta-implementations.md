# JUTA Implementations

JUTA is one of the specifications defined by the JavaScript Entreprise Container project.
The aim of JEC is to provide abstraction layers to standardize, and to add portability to, JavaScript applications.

You do not need to embed a JUTA implementation within your project to write unit tests; but you must have one installed to run them.
