# JEC at a Glance

JavaScript Enterprise Container _(JEC)_ is the standard in community-driven enterprise software built over JavaScript and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) technologies.

JEC is an open source project that executes JavaScript code server-side to deploy Web applications, such as microservices, RESTful APIs, CDN platforms, etc.

## Why JEC?

Modern enterprise softwares are built over API management and container orchestration paradigms to tackle scalability issues and management of complex distributed systems concerns.

For that purpose, JEC provides an efficient and easy-to-use alternative to Java EE and Spring Boot applications.

**JEC:**
- starts much more faster than Spring Boot
- is familiar to both, Java and JavaScript developers
- serves stateless applications by default
- is cross-platform
- simplifies development of microservices
